  <p class="w3-center"><em>Integrative Evidence-Based Programmes</em></p>
  <p>This partnership is a simple powerful integration of fundamental principles from Western science and business (evidence-based) with Eastern philosophy and mind-training practices. From the early 1980’s integration has been a principle guiding the direction and growth of the main institutions that govern the well-being of societies – medicine, education and the workplace. The primary asset that measures productivity and performance is no longer the machine but the human mind. In a world economy marked by complexity and uncertainty, integrative programmes provide radical L & D solutions that transform rigid and fixed mind sets (and their non-performing behaviours) to ones that create opportunity and growth for both the individual and the organisation. As a result capital investment in human resources is now focused on the potential of the human mind.</p>

  <br>

  <p>Put simply, this means the bottom-line and indeed the survival of the organisation depend on the extent to which the individuals within it put their heads together for the benefit of all. The business case is compelling: Nobel prize winning research demonstrates how increased resiliency, stress reduction, and improved immune functioning means significantly less absenteeism and presenteeism The capacity to focus and act with clarity and integrity are yielding clear improvements in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) decision-making</p>

  <p>Talented, innovative and energised people are retained and develop key leadership skills and attributes Enhanced cognitive skills like focused concentration and problem-solving are improving productivity and the management of complexities Directly harnesses and develops Emotional Intelligence (EI) with improving working relationships and vastly improved communication Time and energy management naturally improves with meetings proving more effective and projects delivering on time At any level within the organisation, the difference between informed intelligent responses vs. impulsive automatic reactivity is the critical outcome of Integrative evidence-based Programmes.</p>

 <p><em>To cultivate a lasting Integrative evidence-based Programme ethos into the culture of your organisation, we establish a temporary business partnership with your organisation.  

      Our approach

      The business model we use is highly cost effective as it gives your organisation access to our expertise and the time-frame necessary to embed a sustainable learning and development programme.


      Although this partnership with your organisation is temporary, the design and delivery process is thorough and comprehensive.


      Integrative evidence-based Programmes are integrated into your organisation in three distinct phases
      </em></p>

      <p>
      PHASE ONE<br>

      This is the design phase where a bespoke approach works best – we have discovered in our business model that preparing the ground well yields the richest harvest

      We ask the right and wise questions in the initial consultancy process which normally takes two weeks:

      Firstly, we pay attention to the big picture =

      The particular sector – profit or not-for-profit?
      The particular industry – manufacturing, finance, technology
      The company’s story so far – an historical and geographical survey
      The company’s mission and culture– we want to align our programmes to the established values and cultural norms
      And, equally attend to the important details =

      What’s called for now? An emphasis on leadership? Innovation? Strategic Planning? Communications? Team building? Developing a Great Place to Work? Occupational Health and Wellness? Managing adversity?
      What HR Learning and Development budget is available?
      What are the existing resources we can make use of? The physical space? The existing communication channels? The existing IT resources?
      What quantitative and qualitative measurements will be used to evaluate the success of the programme?
      Now we can create an integrated programme by drawing on other theoretical frameworks – Emotional Intelligence for example – and choosing the kind of tools and techniques that studies demonstrate are perfectly aligned to your goals.
      </p>


      <p>
      PHASE TWO<br>

      This is the delivery phase when the Integrative Programme we have designed for you goes live within an agreed timeframe. We create engaging learning environments and use a stimulating curriculum with proven learning and development methods. The preference is to implement the training on-site in the interests of immediate applicability (and therefore retention and sustainability).

      We use an innovative curriculum delivery model using a proven regime that optimises high performance skills and attributes:

      One-to-one learning pods (coaching sessions)
      Lunchtime lecture series (interesting and interactive talks)
      Group Sessions (engaging in live Mindfulness practices)
      Existing communication channels and IT resources bring innovative ways of cultivating mindfulness into daily working life
      Programme leader on-site means day-to-day inevitable challenges or adversities can be used as immediate opportunities for learning and practice
      </p>

      <p>
      PHASE THREE<br>

      This is the deliberation phase where effectiveness is measured and outcomes are reflected upon. In order to leave a sustainable programme in place, the elements that worked well are harnessed and those elements that are not yielding the kind of desired results are fruitfully abandoned.

      Our business model focuses attention in this phase on the future return on your investment and its sustainability
      This includes harnessing the energy and enthusiasm of what we call the ‘insider champions’ and utilising the organisation’s existing resources in innovative ways.
      Most of our clients find it useful to engage in ‘top-up’ days in the years to follow to ensure the vitality and effectiveness of the programme continues to respond with highly desirable outcomes.
      </p><br>

      <p>
      Medical & Psychological Health Professionals
      <br>
      Proactive and preventative training programmes specifically tailored to the occupational health needs of Medical & Mental Health Professionals in Irish contexts.
      These successful programmes are built with four integrated components: Contemplative and Reflective practices, Discursive exercises with peers and relevant Didactic input to support effective responses to recognised stressors such as burnout.

      Occupational stress is a recognised hazard for many workers including medical professionals. The key to managing this hazard is prevention and early recognition. When demands significantly outweigh resources over any extended period, chronic stress, anxiety and burnout can occur. This is particularly difficult for body/mind medicine professionals, their patients/clients and their families but can be easily addressed.

      Integrative evidence-based Programmes are achieving international recognition as prolific studies in diverse populations are consistently showing positive results across a wide range of health concerns such as stress, chronic illness, pain management, and depression.

Leadership Development Programme<br>

The Challenge

Global organisational models are replacing the command, control, and compartmentalised orientations of the past.
Traditions, cultural norms, and hierarchical cultures are being systematically transformed into cross –functional entities.
Horizontal structures and virtual communications put much higher demands on the emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills of world class leaders.
he effects of chronic stress and constant states of reactivity are limiting our leaders’ crucial ability to sustain levels of awareness critical to their effectiveness.
Potent leaders need to identify and articulate the organisational vision, act with clarity amidst ever present complexities, and constantly contain and model adaptation to unprecedented rates of change.


The Solution
Cultivating practices of excellent leadership allows decision-makers to turn toward inevitable challenges with insightful, strategic innovations and highly effective responses.
Resonant Leadership is highly attuned to markets, contexts and growth opportunities – it creates and sustains change with forensic precision.
Evidence clearly demonstrates excellent leaders consistently draw on emotional intelligence and their capacity for resonance – accurate interpretation of their people’s needs, markets and contexts – visible in their power to precisely align organisational talents with objectives.
Resonant Leadership requires prioritised investment in our leaders resiliency,capacity for reflection, connection to cutting edge resources and critically, ongoing access to their own and their peers tacit knowledge.

  Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction<br>

Although Mindfulness is primarily rooted in Eastern spiritual traditions, in recent years it has been brought together with aspects of western psychology to form a secular programme. Usually taught over 8 weeks, the programme promotes self-awareness, personal development and general well-being.

The original 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Programme (MBSR) was developed in 1979 at the University of Massachusetts Medical Centre (UMass) by Dr. Jon Kabat Zinn.

Since then the programme has been adapted by others in various psychological and medical settings to address the specific health needs of different groups as well as being adapted for more general use in the community, for example mindfulness for adolescents, and in other arenas, such as prisons.

Extensive research has shown that MBSR is beneficial to patients with medical conditions (including chronic illness and pain, high blood pressure,cancer, vascular and respiratory disorders and many others), psychological distress (including anxiety, panic, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances) as well as in preventative medicine and wellness programmes. MBSR has become part of a newly recognised field of integrative medicine within behavioural medicine and general health care.

Since it’s inception, more than 18,000 people have completed the MBSR programme at UMass. There are currently MBSR programmes running in 240 hospitals in the USA.

More recently, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for recurrent depression courses have been developed by Zindel Segal, Mark Williams and John Teasdale. Based on the MBSR programme and including aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), the MBCT course was originally designed specifically for people who experience recurrent bouts of depression.

Participants are taught skills to assist them in disengaging from habitual ‘automatic’ unhelpful cognitive patterns. The pattern of mind that makes people vulnerable to depressive relapse is rumination, in which the mind repetitively reruns negative thoughts. The core skill that MBCT is teaching is to intentionally ‘shift mental gears’.

There is little emphasis in MBCT, as in conventional CBT, on striving to change one’s beliefs or the content of one’s thoughts. The focus is on training to become more aware, moment by moment, of physical sensations and of thoughts and feelings as mental events. This provides a ‘decentred’ relationship to thoughts and feelings in which one can see them as aspects of experience which move through our awareness, rather that a fixed reality.

“The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently endorsed MBCT as an effective treatment for prevention of relapse. Research has shown that people who have been clinically depressed 3 or more times (sometimes over twenty years or more) find that taking the program and learning these skills helps to reduce considerably their chances that depression will return. The evidence from two randomized clinical trials of MBCT indicates that it reduces rates of relapse by 50% among patients who suffer from recurrent depression.” (Ma and Teasdale, 2004., Teasdale et al 2000).

An amalgamated version of the two above named courses has been developed by the Centre of Mindfulness Research and Practice at the University of Wales, Bangor. They have called their programme MBCT for Stress, using aspects of both MBSR and MBCT for a broader population. The course borrows heavily from MBSR and involves some basic aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy, such as learning about thinking patterns and the links between thought and emotion.
